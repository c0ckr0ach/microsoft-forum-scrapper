Despite lengthy tech support assistance from Dell, I was advised to reset my computer to a new version of the Windows operating system that was on my system. Before the reset, I initiated the \"save my OneDrive account\", music, and videos. After the reset, I have some files, but not my Documents folder and Pictures folder. I know OneDrive has my files and Word, but a technician said the link is broken, and I don't know what the heck he was talking about so I quickly got off the phone with him. The weird thing is the recovery process pulled files from different users, like my partner's and my deceased mother-in-law's computer, and I don't know how that happened.

When launched, the app opens in an oversized \"monster\" window\u00e2\u0080\u0094often spanning multiple screens and ignoring saved window state.\nThe problem appeared the first time after the August 2025 update and disappeared. It appeared again after the September update. Both Windows and the Copilot app are on the latest level.\nObserved Behavior:\n\n Copilot launches in a massive window, not respecting previous size or position\n Resizing manually works temporarily, but the issue returns on relaunch\n Behavior persists across reboots and display configuration changes\n I have discovered that the Copilot app at its start opens in the minimized window which spreads across two monitors.\n\nAs a workaround I have reduced this monster size minimized window to a smaller size which can fit on the monitor.  Clicking on the window maximize icon restores the app window. If the Copilot app is stopped with the window in its maximized size it will open next time again in the minimized size, except that it is now acceptable.\nSystem Context:\n\n Windows 11 Pro, latest updates installed\n Dual-monitor setup (primary 1080p, secondary 1080p)\n Copilot app pinned to taskbar, launched via Win+C or icon\n\nTroubleshooting Attempts:\n\n Verified registry entries for window metrics\u00e2\u0080\u0094no persistent fix\n Checked for Copilot-specific settings or flags\u00e2\u0080\u0094none found\n\nIs there a known workaround or registry tweak to enforce window size/position on launch? Or is this a bug that needs escalation?\nHappy to share logs or test solutions\u00e2\u0080\u0094this is part of a broader workflow protocol I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m refining for reproducible UI behavior.\n",

            "It is great that Hendrik provided a \"potential\" solution, but as others have mentioned this does not actually solve the problem.\nLikewise I found the ONLY way to make network sharing work again is to uninstall the KB5065426!!!\nHaving a patch from Microsoft which kills network sharing is extremely poor and will likely affect thousands of people who shre files at home or many SMB.  \nMicrosoft - wake up and fix this issue!\n",
            "I have performed additional tests using some machines which were cloned (thus having the same machine Security Identifier (machine SID)) with and without KB5065426 applied to Windows 11 24H2. \nIf KB5065426 is installed, then file or print sharing between any cloned computer with same machine Security Identifier (machine SID) - FAILS.\nIf KB5065426 is uninstalled, then file or print sharing between any cloned computer with same machine Security Identifier (machine SID) - WORKS.\nIf KB5065426 is installed, then file or print sharing between any computer which has different machine Security Identifier (machine SID) - WORKS.\nSo it seems clear that now after decades Microsoft has killed/blocked file sharing and printer sharing due the same machine SID.\nMicrosoft - wake up and fix this issue!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  or provide a way to disable the machine SID check\n",
            "To validate that it is the machine SID which is the root cause of failed microsoft file sharing between PCs when both computers have KB5065426 installed, I conducted the following test.  \n\n I made two identical virtual machines which I confirmed had the same machine SID as my desktop.\n The first virtual machine copy was used as the reference machine and would always refuse to connect to my desktop windows share (constantly asking for username & password).\n The second virtual machine copy as one would expect also did not connect to my desktop windows share (constantly asking for username & password).  But this is expected if the machine SID is the cause.\n On the second virtual machine copy, I then use the tool SIDCHG to change the machine SID and allowed it to reboot.\n On the second virtual machine copy, I checked and confirmed that the machine SID had been changed and was now different to the other VM and my desktop machine SID.\n On the second virtual machine copy, I then attempted to connect to the network share on my desktop and it worked  exactly as it should :)\n So the only thing which changed in all of this was the machine SID of the second virtual machine copy. \n Now that I had validated this hypothesis usign some virtual machines, I found another cloned PC with same machine SID which was exhibiting the same failure to connect to my desktop windows share (constantly asking for username & password). After changing the machine SID with SIDCHG on that computer and rebooting, it could then access the network share on my desktop without constantly asking for username & password time & time again.\n\nAlso be aware in some instances, I have also seen KB5065426 disable file & print sharing, so you may find sometimes this needs to be re-enabled.\nIn a few other test I have also noticed that after KB5065426 a network can inexplicably be changed from being  private to public or vice versa.\n",

            "Dear A T,\nThank you for reaching out to the Microsoft Q&A.\nTo give you a direct answer: It is highly unlikely that all the data from your old laptop will fit on a 32GB memory stick.\nWhile it's possible if you have only used your computer for a very small number of documents and photos, most people accumulate far more data than that over a few years of use. Think of it this way: a single 10-minute video from a modern smartphone can be over 1GB, and a large photo library can easily exceed 30GB on its own.\nYou can buy an external hard drive (HDD) or a faster external solid-state drive (SSD) with 1 Terabyte (1TB = 1,000GB) of storage for a very reasonable price. This gives you more than enough space for the transfer and can be used as a regular backup device afterward.\nYou can also use Cloud Storage (OneDrive or Google Drive) to transfer your files. Moreover, it also creates a backup.\n\nTo assist others who might have similar questions and to help us improve our support system, we kindly encourage you to \"Accept the answer\" if it successfully addressed your concern.

            "Hi. I'm David, and I'm happy to help you.\n\nThe BlueScreenView has not been giving reliable information recently.\n\nPlease share the minidump files.\nThese files are in C:\\Windows\\Minidump.\nCopy any files you have to your desktop and store them in a ZIP file. Then, upload the ZIP file to the cloud (OneDrive), choose to share it, and get the link.\nThen, post the link to the ZIP file here so I can have a look.\n\nI await your reply.\n",
            "Sorry for the delay in reply. I've been offline.\n\nThe minidumps you provided do not reference any drivers, but they all point to the system process \"svchost.exe\" as the cause of the crash. Since each crash shares the same stop code, \"CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED\", there's a strong possibility that \"svchost.exe\" is corrupted or damaged.\n\nI think it's a good idea to try the SFC (System File Checker) to fix possible corrupted system files before trying anything more intrusive.\n\n Open Start and type cmd, right-click on \"Command Prompt\", and select \"Run as administrator\".\n Run the following commands at the Command Prompt one at a time:\n\ndism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth\ndism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth\ndism.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup\nsfc /scannow\n\nNote: Pay close attention to the results of the commands. This will help you determine whether the procedure was completed successfully or if there was a problem. If you get any errors, let me know the error message that was displayed.\n\n Restart the PC.\n\nAfter restarting the PC, see if the system will work stably.\n\nIf the BSOD occurs again, please share the minidump it created.\n\nFeel free to ask back any questions.\n",
            "In this case, I suggest you perform an In-place Upgrade. This procedure reinstalls Windows, which helps to fix problems.\nBut don't worry. It's a simple procedure, and you have the option to keep files, settings, and apps. Therefore, all your data is kept.\n(If you have a third-party antivirus installed, temporarily disable it during the entire procedure.)\n\nDownload the ISO file to perform the procedure:\n\n Access the link below;\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11\n\n Under Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO), click Select download and select Windows 11 (multi-edition ISO for x64 devices);\n Click Download;\n Choose the language and click on Confirm;\n Then, click 64-bit Download.\n Wait for the download to finish and proceed to the procedure below.\n\n\nAfter downloading the ISO, do the following:\n\n Double-click the ISO to run;\n\n(After running the ISO, you may need to double-click the Setup file to start the procedure.)\n\n On the Install Windows 11 screen, uncheck I want to help make the installation of Windows better and select Change how Windows Setup download updates;\n On the next screen, select Not right now and click Next;\n Accept the terms of use;\n On the Ready to install screen, select Choose what to keep and select what you want to keep.\n\n(It is in this step that you must check Keep personal files and apps so that all your data is kept.)\n\n Click on Install and wait for the procedure to finish. Your computer may restart several times.\n\n\nAfter the procedure is complete, see if the system will work stably.\n\nIf you get any errors or the problem persists, please let me know.\n\nFeel free to ask back any questions.\n",
            "Sorry for the delay in reply. I've been offline.\nThanks for the clarification.\n\nI believe that, given the issues you experienced with In-Place Upgrade, a clean install is a good idea. And there's another detail: Blue screen issues don't survive a clean install unless they're caused by a hardware issue.\n\nTo perform a clean install, you will need an installation media.\nIf you don't have an installation media, create one using the Media Creation Tool.\nYou can create the installation media on an empty USB flash drive with at least 8GB.\n\nBelow are instructions for creating installation media on a USB flash drive.\n\n Download the tool from the link below;\n\nhttps://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2156295\n\n Double-click on the downloaded file to run the tool;\n If prompted by UAC (User Account Control), click on \"Yes\";\n Read the terms and click \"Accept\" if you agree;\n Leave the \"Use the recommended options for this PC\" box checked and click \"Next.\"\n Select \"USB flash drive\" and click \"Next\".\n Connect the USB flash drive you want to use, click the \"Refresh drive list\" link, select the USB flash drive, and click \"Next\";\n\n(Note that the files on the USB flash drive will be deleted. Make a backup of the files if necessary.)\n\n Wait for the procedure to finish and click \"Finish\" when the USB flash drive is ready.\n\n\nIf necessary, make a copy of your files to an external storage device or a cloud storage service. A clean install will remove all data stored on the system drive.\n\nThen, access the article below, go to the end of the article, and expand \"Clean install\" under \"Steps to reinstall Windows with media\" to see the instructions.\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/reinstall-windows-with-the-installation-media-d8369486-3e33-7d9c-dccc-859e2b022fc7#:~:text=Steps%20to%20reinstall%20Windows%20with%20media\nIn your case, start the computer using the installation media and proceed from step 2.\n(You may need to change the BOOT property in the device's BIOS settings.
