Let me help you out. \nBased on the description you provided, you recently purchased Microsoft Surface laptop 7 and the audio and video are out of sync on all streaming platforms. Since you have already covered the common troubleshooting steps (like updating drivers, clearing browser cache and reinstalling), let's move on to some deeper system-level fixes. These have worked for other Surface laptop 7 users experiencing the same sync issues.\n\n Disable Audio Enhancements   Audio Enhancements, especially on devices with Qualcomm audio chips, are a known cause of sync problems.\n\n Right-click the speaker icon in the taskbar > Sound settings\n Under Output, select your default device > Device properties > Additional device properties\n Go to the Enhancements tab and check Disable all enhancements\n Click Apply and restart your system\n\n\n Change the Audio Format   The default audio format can sometimes introduce latency.\n\n Follow the same steps above, but go to the Advance tab\n Try changing the default format to 16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality) or 24 bit, 48000 Hz\n Test playback after each change to see if sync improves\n\n\n Disable Hardware Acceleration in Your Browser   Browsers like Chrome and Edge use GPU acceleration, which can cause audio/video desync.\n\n In Chrome: Settings > System > Toggle off Use hardware acceleration when available\n Restart the browser after making the change\n\n\n Install the Latest Firmware Updates   Even with updated drivers, outdated firmware can cause persistent sync issues.\n\n Visit the official Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 download page https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/2297733/new-surface-laptop-7-audio-video-sync\n Manually download and install the latest firmware and driver package for your model\n\n\n Test with Local Playback   Try playing a downloaded video using the built-in Movies & TV app instead of streaming.\n\n If sync issues occur even with local files, it's likely a deeper system-level audio processing issue - not just browser-related.\n\n\n\nIf the issue continues, please donât hesitate to contact us again. Weâre here to help, and we appreciate your continued trust in us.\nWarm Regards,\nApril P.\nIndependent Advisor\n",

        "description": "Need Help: Random BSODs with ntoskrnl.exe and NETIO.SYS Errors - High-End System\nSystem Specifications\n\n CPU: Intel i9-13900K\n Motherboard: ASUS ROG MAXIMUS Z690 FORMULA\n GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti\n RAM: 4x ADATA AX5U6400C4016G-DCCARGY (total 64GB)\n Storage: 2x M.2 SSDs (1 for OS, 1 for games)\n PSU: Corsair HX1200\n BIOS: Latest version 4301 (released 2025/05/26)\n\nProblem Description\nI'm experiencing random Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) crashes on my high-end gaming system. The crashes seem to occur randomly during general use. It happens since I bought my PC in 2022 and I already changed every HW component except the MoBo. Asus EMEA support team that I contacted more than once during those years always refused to change it. During those years the problem seemd to diasappear but in reality some time happened when PC was in idle and I was far from PC for some other reason and didn't provoke frustration. Yesterday started to trigger itself continuosly making PC experience impossible.\nError Information\nThe crashes are associated with these memory addresses:\n\n ntoskrnl.exe+4fec10\n NETIO.SYS+1c688\n NETIO.SYS+23ca8\n ntoskrnl.exe+4f9280\n\nTroubleshooting Steps Already Taken\nDriver Updates\n\n All drivers and BIOS are completely up to date\n Using Intel Driver & Support Assistant for automatic updates\n Following comprehensive driver update guide from ASUS MoBo Driver thread on elevenforum.com\n Manually verified and updated all system drivers\n\nAdvanced Troubleshooting\n\n Driver Verifier: Attempted to use Windows Driver Verifier to identify problematic drivers\n\n Result: System became stuck in restart loop and eventually froze completely\n Had to restore from previous system image to recover\n This suggests a potential driver compatibility issue\n\n\n\nWhat I'm Looking For\n\n Suggestions for identifying which specific driver or hardware component might be causing the crashes\n Alternative methods to Driver Verifier for troubleshooting driver issues\n Experience with similar error addresses on Z690 chipset systems\n Recommendations for memory testing or other hardware diagnostics\n Any known issues with this hardware combination\n\nAdditional Information\n\n System is relatively new but crashes have been occurring intermittently\n No obvious pattern to when crashes occur (not tied to specific applications)\n System runs stable most of the time, crashes are sporadic\n All components are running at stock speeds (no overclocking)\n RAM QVL \n\nAny help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Has anyone experienced similar issues with this hardware combination or these specific error addresses?\n",

        "description": "Frequently, in an effort to solve numerous non-specific problems, questioners are asked to run SFC and DISM.  While I understand WHAT these tools do, I'm not sure HOW Windows system and other files become corrupted and need to be \"fixed.\"  Digital copies are SUPPOSED to be exact and disk files are NOT SUPPOSED to be over-written.  Guess you have some splainin' to do.\nThanks.\n",
